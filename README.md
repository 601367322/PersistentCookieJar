PersistentCookieJar for OkHttp 3
===============================
A persistent CookieJar implementation for OkHttp 3 based on SharedPreferences.

If you're looking for a OkHttp 2/HTTPUrlConnection persistent CookieStore it can be found at [this Gist] [1].

Download
--------
It will be uploaded to JCenter as soon as possible. For now you can clone this repo.

Usage
-----
Create an instance of `PersistentCookieJar` passing a `CookieCache` and a `CookiePersistor`:

```java
ClearableCookieJar cookieJar =
                new PersistentCookieJar(new SetCookieCache(), new SharedPrefsCookiePersistor(context));
```

Then just add the CookieJar when building your OkHttp client:

```java
OkHttpClient okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .cookieJar(cookieJar)
                .build();
```

Features
--------
This is a really simple library but here are some of the things that it provides:
* Possibility to clear the jar: `PersistentCookieJar` implements `ClearableCookieJar` interface that declares a `clear()` method for removing all cookies from the jar.

* Decoupled and extensible: `CookieCache` and `CookiePersitor` are interfaces so you can provide your own implementation for each one.
    * `CookieCache` represents an in-memory cookie storage. `SetCookieCache` is the provided implementation that uses a Set to store the Cookies.
    * `CookiePersistor` represents a persistent storage. `SharedPrefsCookiePersistor` is the provided implementation that uses a SharedPreferences to persist the Cookies.

* Thread-safe: `PersistentCookieJar` public methods are synchronized so there is no need to worry about threading if you need to implement a `CookieCache` or a `CookiePersistor`.
